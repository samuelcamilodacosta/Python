#Read two integer values, in this case, the variables A and B. After this, 
# calculate the sum between them and assign it to the variable SOMA. 
# Write the value of this variable.

variableA = int(input())
variableB = int(input())
variableSOMA = variableB + variableA
print("SOMA =", variableSOMA)
