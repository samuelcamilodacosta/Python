# Read four integer values named A, B, C and D. Calculate and print the difference of

# the following example, with a blank space before and after the equal signal.

variableA = int(input())
variableB = int(input())
variableC = int(input())
variableD = int(input())

differenceProduct = ((variableA*variableB)-(variableC*variableD))
print("DIFERENCA =", differenceProduct)
